**Data Science Intern Case Study**

**Overview**

This project aims to analyze a dataset related to side effects caused by medications. The project involves handling missing data,
encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical variables. The key tasks performed include:

- Loading the dataset
- Filling missing values using KNNImputer
- Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoder
- Standardizing numerical data using StandardScaler
- Visualizing key aspects of the dataset such as gender distribution, top side effects, and the relationship between height and weight
  
**Instructions to Run the Code**
1. Clone the Repository: First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-folder

2. Install Required Libraries: Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3. Run the Python Script: Execute the script to load the dataset, process it, and generate the visualizations:

   python pusula.py

4. Dataset: The dataset should be placed in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file_path variable in the script:

   file_path = '/.../side_effect_data.xlsx'
